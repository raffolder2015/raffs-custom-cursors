# Raff's custom cursors ig
yes cursors
## Installation
as you might've guessed, every mouse zip file comes with a set of files.
one is called installed.inf, it is a file to install stuff ig. DO NOT PLACE IT OUT OF THE FOLDER YOU'RE INSTALLING IT IN.
one shall right-click on the file and click Install. that's it.
if you're crazy or you don't have the install.inf you can also set each cursor to its respective .cur file.
i have no idea about any other operating system; figure that one out
